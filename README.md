**Machine learning pipeline**: 
We constructed a machine learning pipeline using Python (version 3.10.11) and PyCaret (version 3.0.0) in the TCGA-SKCM database. The dataset underwent preprocessing, employing the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to address class imbalance. The selected features were normalized using the MinMaxScaler from scikit-learn (version 1.2.2). Model development incorporated features such as age, gender, T stage, N stage, M stage, and the expression levels of 20 invasion-associated genes. A trainset and testset ratio of 7:3 was used, and stratified ten-fold cross-validation was performed to assess the model's performance and robustness. We compared the performance of 15 classification algorithms to identify the optimal model for predicting SKCM patient prognosis. The machine learning pipeline was implemented in open-source Python code, and [interactive Google Colab notebooks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1PqikmkMxX1vdBiRFSEuL2ALBnTQL4gaF?usp=sharing) are available at https://github.com/EnyuY/IAGs-in-SKCM.
